This plugin will embed the BurnZone Commenting system in your blog. It will definitely improve your readers' commenting experience!

== Description ==

BurnZone Commenting is a fully customizable commenting platform that brings industry first competitive features in addition to all the standard commenting features. We have just released a fully functional BETA version and we would be happy to receive feedback.

Current features:

* Challenges - Every comment on your posts can be challenged. In case someone doesn't agree with one's point of view, he or she can challenge that comment. Users will get a separate section where all the challenges will be displayed and where they can be voted (so there's always a winner) and commented.
* Questions & answers - We actually do understand that comments are different from questions, so why not create separate sections? Questions are properly emphasized and have a better chance to be answered.
* Multiple login options - Commentators can either use a Facebook account, an account on our website or even their account on your website using our Single Sign On.
* Votes & likes - Comments and answers can be liked. Votes appear in challenges. Users get points based on the votes they get. Try hard to get points to be able to spend them on challenges (yes they cost points!) and spawn interesting debates.
* User profiles - Every person commenting on your website will get a profile where the points are stored.
* Sharing - sharing is caring. Users can always share on Twitter and Facebook comments, challenges, questions, answers or even an entire conversation.

You can easily moderate the activity through "BurnZone Moderator" area in your dashboard.

Please let us know about any kind of recommendation you might have or any issue you come across.

How does this plugin work?

Simply put, what this plugin does is replacing your default comments template with an iframe. This will load its content (including comments) from an external source, meaning our servers. This brings you another benefit, which is reducing your server load.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload the plugin to your website either directly via the WordPress plugin directory or via FTP, copying the plugin folder to "/wp-content/plugins/".
1. Register an account on BurnZone and add your site in the admin section on the website.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Fill in the details in the BurnZone settings and you're done! Your new comments will take benefit from this commenting platform.

To be able to use Single Sign On you will have to download the plugin again from BurnZone public site.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why does BurnZone say that it could not load the conversation? =

There are two main reasons for this error:
1. You are trying to load an article from localhost. We only support articles that are publicly available.
2. You did not configure the plugin. Please register a site at BurnZone and set the site name in the plugin options.

= Why is the text not readable? =

Our automatic theme engine selected the wrong theme. Go to [BurnZone settings](http://www.theburn-zone.com) and manually select the theme that matches your design.

== Screenshots ==

1. This is how our commenting system looks (comments section) on a page.
2. Challenges tab. Here are listed all the challenges.
3. Single challenge screen. This is how it looks when someone challenges another person.
4. Questions tab. Here are listed all the questions.
5. Single question screen. Every question can be answered and every answer can be commented.
